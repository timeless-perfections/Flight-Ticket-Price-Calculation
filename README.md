# Flight-Ticket-Price-Calculation
I made a program with Java that calculates air ticket prices according to distance and conditions. 
I received distance (KM), age and trip type (One Way, Round-Trip) information from the user and charged 0.10 TL/km per distance. 
First, I calculated the total price of the flight and then applied the following discounts to the customer according to the conditions; 
Values from the user must be valid (distance and age are positive numbers, trip type is 1 or 2). Otherwise, "You Have Entered Incorrect Data!" A warning should be given.
If the person is younger than 12 years old, 50% discount is applied on the ticket price.
If the person is between 12-24 years old, 10% discount is applied on the ticket price. If the person is over the age of 65, a 30% discount is applied on the ticket price.
If the person prefers "Travel Type" round trip, 20% discount is applied on the ticket price.
